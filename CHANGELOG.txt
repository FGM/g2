        - Themable functions are now used correctly within the module itself
        - Added wrappers around all theme functions for themeability
2006-01-11
        - Taxonomy terms are no longer displayed or returned by WOTD for 
          freetagging vocabularies, unless admin so chooses. They are only 
          available to g2 node editors.
        - Security: RPC is now disabled by default.
        - a new setting has been added to allow site admins to relax the
          "entries must include a definition" requirement
        - definition teasers including html code are now stripped instead of
          being converted to plain text
2006-01-02
        - title for the “entries by initial” page now includes the initial
          for http://drupal.org/node/43479
        - override/extend the author name for entries when displayed in the
          WOTD RSS feed
2006-01-01
        - items in the WOTD RSS feed are now dated with the day they are
          requested instead of the node creation date.
        - G2-generated links in the RSS feed (and on node pages) are now
          absolute: feed now validates without warnings.
        - Setting for the description of the WOTD RSS feed
        - Setting for the title of the WOTD RSS feed, now distinct from the
          title of the WOTD block, but defaulting to it if nulled
        - RSS feed for word of the day http://drupal.org/node/43078
        - homonyms disambiguation page at “<drupal>/g2/entries/<someterm>” is
          now customizable at the site level, and themeable, and can thus be
          overriden both by site webmasters and by themes
          for http://drupal.org/node/42965
        - main page at <drupal>/g2 is now themeable, and can thus be
          overriden by themes (it could already be overriden by site webmasters)
        - added G2 path in content/add
        - WOTD autochange now works
        - fixed constant name errors in g2_settings: constants in that form
          were not duly prefixed.
        - Setting to enable auto-jump from disambiguation on single entry
          match for http://drupal.org/node/42947
        - Setting to toggle display of taxonomy terms in random and WOTD blocks
          for http://drupal.org/node/42928
2005-12-31

2005-12-30
        - Patches for Naudefj http://drupal.org/node/42750
        - Code cleanup: many strings moved to one of the constant groups on top
          of the file for easier maintenability, notably all of the persistent
          variable names http://drupal.org/node/42750
        - Setting to optimize search on entry titles

2005-12-29
        - Version 1.0 Beta 1 (on the G2 wiki)
        - page by initial segment now works (in other words,
          the alphabar points to valid pages)
2005-12-28
        - All four predefined blocks are now fully themeable.
        - The initial themeing functions theme_g2_wotd_teaser and

          unpublished nodes.
