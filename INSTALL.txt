Installation notes
------------------

1. execute g2.mysql on your server to add the G2 schema extension
2. copy the g2 directory to <drupal>/modules/g2
3. activate the module in administer/modules

The module is ready.

You are advised to define one or more vocabularies and their terms
in taxonomy.module to classify your entries.

Associate the new vocabularies to the g2_entry node type.

  . To create entries, choose create content / G2 entry
  . To create G2 links from your nodes to G2 definitions:
    . activate the G2 glossary filter in administer / input formats / configure
    . wrap the terms from which you want to link in <dfn> elements

  On Drupal.org:
        http://drupal.org/node/41641
  Or on the G2 Wiki:
        http://wiki.audean.com/doku.php?id=g2:start

Now that I (fgm on drupal.org / osinet on IRC) have CVS access on Drupal.org, 
the latest G2 versions are no longer made available on the wiki, only on
Drupal.org

Feel free to request features or report bugs on Drupal.org: this is still
a beta version.
