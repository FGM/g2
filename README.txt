Glossary2 (G2)

=============================================================================
G2 is a glossary module written for Drupal 4.7.

It is not intended as a direct replacement for glossary.module
which has been already available with drupal for quite some time now,
but as an alternative for sites needing a glossary for a large number of entries, 
or a difference feature set.

Unlike glossary.module, is uses nodes for its definitions,
and does not automatically link terms in other nodes to their entries in G2.

Buzzword-compliance: XML-RPC Web services, AJAX UI (some)

Its development to this date has been entirely sponsored by OSInet.fr

A word of warning: due to G2 targeting high-volume glossaries and including
its own APIs and features, the code is heavier than glossary.module: the base
4.7 version source for G2 is more than twice the volume of the base 4.7
version source for glossary. It may be too heavy for sites on very limited
hosting plans.
