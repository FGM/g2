Glossary2 (G2)

=============================================================================
G2 is a glossary module written for Drupal 4.7.

It is not intended as a direct replacement for the glossary module
that has been already available with drupal for quite some time now, 
but as an alternative for sites needing a glossary for a large number of entries.

Unlike glossary.module, is uses nodes for its definitions, 
and does not automatically link terms in other nodes to their entries in G2.

Buzzword-compliance:
  XML-RPC Web services
  AJAX UI (some)

Its development to this date has been entirely sponsored by OSInet.fr
